PyBullet: Physics Simulation for Robotics and Machine Learning
Speaker: Jasmine Hsu

Abstract: The Brain Robotics team at Google aims to improve robotics via machine learning. We foster close collaborations between machine learning researchers, engineers, and roboticists to enable learning at scale on real and simulated robotic systems. The Bullet Physics engine is a heavyweight open-source physics SDK that provides real-time collision detection and multi-physics simulation for VR, games, visual effects, robotics, and machine learning. In order make our physics simulation easier to use, we created Python bindings (PyBullet) to allow our team to quickly and efficiently scale research initiatives. Come hear our talk to learn how you can now easily use Python to apply deep learning approaches to robotics!
